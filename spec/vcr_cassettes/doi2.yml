        how these authors explore, test, and question the ways in which social norms

        or subvert particular behavioral codes, they also draw attention to the constructed
        nature of the ways in which human beings possess and use the spaces around
        them.  These novels perpetuate the separation of public and private spaces

        of the barriers between exterior and interior means that private and public

        how these authors explore, test, and question the ways in which social norms
        are mapped onto physical and psychic spaces. As these representations enforce
        or subvert particular behavioral codes, they also draw attention to the constructed
        nature of the ways in which human beings possess and use the spaces around
        them.  These novels perpetuate the separation of public and private spaces
        and the fixed gender roles assigned to each space to encourage the incipient
        bourgeoisie and its accompanying middle-class ideals. The insistent linkage
        of gender identity and space results in restrictions on women\u2019s mobility,

        book investigates the notion of conversational dominance in depth, and seeks
        to establish a systematic method of analysing it. It also offers a new insight
        into the role of gender and the pragmatic transfer of conversational norms
        in the first and second language conversations among native speakers of Japanese.\n\t\tDrawing
        upon a critical synthesis of insights from several different fields, including
        Conversation Analysis, the Birmingham school of discourse analysis, and dialogical
        analysis, the author proposes an innovative analytical framework for operationalising
        the concept of dominance in conversation. She then applies this framework
        to the empirical analysis of Japanese speakers\u2019 L1 and L2 conversations,
        finding direct evidence for the important role of gender and pragmatic transfer
        in conversational dominance.\n\t\tBy integrating quantitative and qualitative
        approaches to discourse analysis, the author offers a new perspective into
        the pragmatic transfer of conversational norms. She does so by demonstrating
        how the notion of self-oriented and other-oriented conversational styles and
        strategies can affect the level of transfer of interactional behaviour differently
        for male and female speakers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1075\/pbns.89","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,16]],"date-time":"2013-12-16T22:56:33Z","timestamp":1387234593000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":20,"title":["Conversational

        author combines a syntax-theoretical treatment of telicity marking and an
        empirical study of the second language acquisition of English telicity marking
        by native speakers of Bulgarian, a Slavic language. It is argued that Vendler\u0092s
        lexical classes of verbs (states, activities, accomplishments and achievements)
        can be represented in four phrase structure templates, where lexical properties
        of the verb and of the object compositionally determine telicity. A parameterized
        distinction between English and Slavic aspect is proposed. The book addresses
        two major acquisition issues: (1) what is the nature of the initial hypothesis
        Bulgarian learners of English entertain regarding telicity marking (i.e.,
        is there native language transfer)? (2) are adult learners capable of resetting
        the telicity marking parameter? Both L1 transfer and parameter resetting are
        experimentally supported. In addition, the study investigates the L2 acquisition
        of a cluster of complex predicate constructions, purportedly related to the

        monograph is a theoretical and empirical investigation into the mechanisms
        and causes of successful and unsuccessful adult second language acquisition.Couched
        within a generative framework, the study explores how a learner\u2019s first
        language and the age at which they acquire their second language may contribute
        to the L2 knowledge that they can ultimately attain. The empirical study focuses
        on a group of very advanced L2 speakers, and through a series of tests aims
        to discover what underpins their near mastery of grammatical gender and other
        grammatical properties.The book explores an account of persistent selective
        divergence based on the idea that child and adult learners are fundamentally
        similar, except that in adults the L1 plays the role of a fairly rigid filter
        of the linguistic input. The impossibility of representing the new target

        influence of cognitive processing on second language acquisition (SLA), and
        on the development of second language (SL) instruction, has always been a
        subject of major interest to both SLA researchers and those involved in SL
        pedagogy. Recent theoretical research into SLA and SL pedagogy has shown renewed
        interest in the role of cognitive variables such as attention, short, working,
        and long term memory, and automaticity of language processing. This volume
        first examines the theoretical foundations of research into the cognitive
        processes underlying SLA, and then describes various implications for pedagogically
        oriented research and for SL classroom practice. The blend of research from
        the cognitive sciences and applied linguistics make it an excellent introduction
        to applied linguists and language teachers interested in the psycholinguistic
        processes underlying SLA.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/cbo9781139524780","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,6]],"date-time":"2012-10-06T15:06:41Z","timestamp":1349536001000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":127,"title":["Cognition

        book investigates the notion of conversational dominance in depth, and seeks
        to establish a systematic method of analysing it. It also offers a new insight
        into the role of gender and the pragmatic transfer of conversational norms
        in the first and second language conversations among native speakers of Japanese.\n\t\tDrawing
        upon a critical synthesis of insights from several different fields, including
        Conversation Analysis, the Birmingham school of discourse analysis, and dialogical
        analysis, the author proposes an innovative analytical framework for operationalising
        the concept of dominance in conversation. She then applies this framework
        to the empirical analysis of Japanese speakers\u2019 L1 and L2 conversations,
        finding direct evidence for the important role of gender and pragmatic transfer
        in conversational dominance.\n\t\tBy integrating quantitative and qualitative
        approaches to discourse analysis, the author offers a new perspective into
        the pragmatic transfer of conversational norms. She does so by demonstrating
        how the notion of self-oriented and other-oriented conversational styles and
        strategies can affect the level of transfer of interactional behaviour differently
        for male and female speakers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1075\/pbns.89","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,16]],"date-time":"2013-12-16T22:56:33Z","timestamp":1387234593000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":20,"title":["Conversational

        author combines a syntax-theoretical treatment of telicity marking and an
        empirical study of the second language acquisition of English telicity marking
        by native speakers of Bulgarian, a Slavic language. It is argued that Vendler\u0092s
        lexical classes of verbs (states, activities, accomplishments and achievements)
        can be represented in four phrase structure templates, where lexical properties
        of the verb and of the object compositionally determine telicity. A parameterized
        distinction between English and Slavic aspect is proposed. The book addresses
        two major acquisition issues: (1) what is the nature of the initial hypothesis
        Bulgarian learners of English entertain regarding telicity marking (i.e.,
        is there native language transfer)? (2) are adult learners capable of resetting
        the telicity marking parameter? Both L1 transfer and parameter resetting are
        experimentally supported. In addition, the study investigates the L2 acquisition
        of a cluster of complex predicate constructions, purportedly related to the
        telicity parameter in the grammatical competence and in child language acquisition

        as compared with \u2018top-down\u2019 processes as they affect memory. It
        also discusses second language learning from the acquisition\/learning and
        nativist\/connectionist perspectives. These ideas are then related to the
        methods that are used to teach second languages, primarily English, in formal
        classroom situations. This examination involves both \u2018mainstream\u2019
        communicative approaches, and more traditional methods widely used to teach
        EFL throughout the world. The book is intended to act both as a textbook for
        students who are studying second language teaching and as an exploration of
        issues for the interested teacher who would like to further extend their understanding
        of the cognitive processes underlying their teaching.<\/jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>Mick

        monograph is a theoretical and empirical investigation into the mechanisms
        and causes of successful and unsuccessful adult second language acquisition.Couched
        within a generative framework, the study explores how a learner\u2019s first
        language and the age at which they acquire their second language may contribute
        to the L2 knowledge that they can ultimately attain. The empirical study focuses
        on a group of very advanced L2 speakers, and through a series of tests aims
        to discover what underpins their near mastery of grammatical gender and other
        grammatical properties.The book explores an account of persistent selective
        divergence based on the idea that child and adult learners are fundamentally
        similar, except that in adults the L1 plays the role of a fairly rigid filter
        of the linguistic input. The impossibility of representing the new target
        language other than by using the building blocks of the previously established
        L1 is argued to be the main reason why near but not totally native like language
        representations are formed and become established in adult L2 learners.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1075\/lald.38","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,16]],"date-time":"2013-12-16T22:41:40Z","timestamp":1387233700000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":158,"title":["Fossilized

        first examines the theoretical foundations of research into the cognitive
        processes underlying SLA, and then describes various implications for pedagogically
        oriented research and for SL classroom practice. The blend of research from
