definition: |
  An `AttributeProfile` represents name, cardinalities and value type of an
  attribute in a model that complies with a profile that includes this
  AttributeProfile.

  If it represents an attribute that has been previously defined, e.g. an
  attribute in Address model defined in <<ISO19160-1>>, it extends the
  definition of the attribute by redefining the name, cardinalities and value
  type.
