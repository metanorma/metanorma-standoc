definition: |
  An `AddressClassProfile` represents a profile of a `ProfileCompliantAddress`.
  It corresponds to the concept of an `AddressClass` originally
  expressed in <<ISO19160-1>> as a referenced codelist.

  It represents additional attributes and restrictions to the
  `ProfileCompliantAddress` model. It also represents metadata for the use of
  the profile.

  A single profile can include and support multiple types of
  address formats, such as a numbered street address and a
  "`PO Box`" address simultaneously. Each of these address formats
  is represented as an interchange address class.

  [example]
  --
  The US Numbered Thoroughfare Address with this syntax can be
  represented as an address class profile:

  *{sp}{ Complete Landmark Name or Complete Place Name } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Address Number * } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Street Name * } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Subaddress } +
  *{sp}{ Complete Place Name * } +
  *{sp}{ State Name * } +
  *{sp}{ Zip Code } +
  *{sp}{ Zip Plus 4 } +
  *{sp}{ Country Name }
